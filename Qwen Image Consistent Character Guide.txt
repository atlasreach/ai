Step 1: Create portrait image using Wan 2.2 Instagirl


This part of the guide is identical to the training step for the Wan 2.2 model. However I have attached a new workflow for better and more unique-looking faces. 


In this first step, you’ll generate an initial base image of your AI influencer. Ideally, this base image should feature a clear, front-facing view of the influencer’s facial features, as this will allow image editing models to create consistent variations across different angles and shots.


Use the Runpod template links below with a corresponding workflow for Confyui. Simply drag and drop the json file into the Comfyui interface once the Runpod container loads up. I recommend using the 5090 template (the second template link) to launch the container. 


Runpod Template (5090 GPU does not work on this): https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=v4pv63e3yi&ref=i2biwt7p

Workflow Path: \Wan\Wan 2.2\Instagirls\Instagirl-portrait.json


As an example, I have provided some example prompts to generate your portrait image. 


1. Instagirl, A mid-shot portrait of a cute young Asian girl with a baby face, framed from head to chest. Her skin looks natural and realistic, with soft light texture and slight uneven tones that give a genuine, lifelike appearance, free of makeup or blush. Her cheeks are gently rounded, adding a youthful fullness. She has wide almond-shaped dark brown eyes, bright and innocent, framed by long lashes with only a hint of eyeliner. Her brows are naturally shaped and soft, complementing her calm, cute expression. She has a small, refined nose and lips with a natural tint and slight moisture, closed in a neutral, relaxed look. Her straight black hair falls simply over her shoulders and chest, smooth and slightly tousled, framing her neckline as she wears a plain off-shoulder white top. Amateur photo, with blown-out highlights from the window creating a soft halo glow, and deep front shadows adding contrast.


2. Instagirl, A mid-shot portrait of a gorgeous Caucasian e-girl, framed from head to chest. She has an exceptionally beautiful face with flawless fair skin glowing softly under natural light, faint freckles scattered across her cheeks and nose for charm. Her almond-shaped blue-gray eyes are luminous and captivating, framed by long curled lashes and delicate eyeliner, radiating innocence mixed with allure. Her brows are naturally full with a graceful arch, accentuating her expressive gaze. She has a refined, slightly narrow nose and plump lips with a glossy rose tint, parted in a gentle, shy neutral expression. A natural blush warms her cheeks, giving her a youthful radiance. Her long, flowing white hair falls in silky waves over her shoulders and chest, framing her cleavage as she wears a fitted off-shoulder white top that emphasizes her full breasts tastefully., amateur photo, extreme blown-out highlights from the window creating a slight halo effect, deeply crushed shadows on her front.


3. Instagirl, Close-up portrait of a young woman with long dark brown hair, tanned skin, and natural freckles across her cheeks and nose. She has deep brown eyes with long lashes, soft pink lips, and a serious intense gaze. A few loose strands of hair fall across her face, and she is wearing a black strapless top. The background is a plain light textured wall. The style is photorealistic, natural lighting, high detail.


Step 2: Create Dataset Images For Training


Creating a high-quality dataset is the foundation of effective LoRA training, ensuring your models learn the right patterns and produce strong results. As I mentioned previously in the video QUALITY of the images is much more important then QUANTITY of your dataset images. Good training images with accurate consistent facial features are extremely important to create your character lora.  


Below are the workflows that my team and other members produced the best quality outputs with. 


Aspect Ratio:
 Training on multiple aspect ratios generally results in a more versatile LoRA. However, since our LoRA models are intended for Instagram and portrait-oriented outputs, most of my dataset is in 960 × 1280 resolution. Ultimately, your aspect ratio choice should match the format you plan to use when generating images later in the workflow with your LoRAs.
Resolution:
 I generated the training images in 4K (4096 × 3077), but since AIToolkit automatically downsamples them to 1024 during training, using such a high resolution isn’t strictly necessary.


Seedream 4.0 (Recommended)


Access Seedream 4.0 here:
Openart: openart.ai/home/?via=seedream4 (With credits you can also access video models)
Wavespeed: https://wavespeed.ai/models/bytedance/seedream-v4/edit
Seedream 4.0 is a powerful tool for creating AI influencers because it combines precision, realism, and flexibility in a single model. It allows creators to merge different portraits, adjust facial features, and generate consistent, high-quality 4K images. This is especially important when training influencer LoRA models, where facial consistency determines how realistic the results look.
One of the biggest advantages of Seedream 4.0 is that it has much lower censorship compared to other image generation models like Nano Banana or Flux Kontext.
There are a couple of effective ways to use Seedream when building your dataset. The first method is to use the “merge” keyword and upload two different images. For example, one of our members, @Dio Brando, used this approach to create his datasets.
Here’s his prompt:
 https://discord.com/channels/1307375915805966458/1370479367620395179/1420822146849964124
Merge the face of the girl in the first image with the girl in the second image. Make it natural and realistic. Blonde hair, large chest, freckles.
The second method is to merge two photos using Canva to create one image, then apply a special prompting technique to replace your character’s face onto the second character image. I’m attaching the example below to create this image.




Input Image 
  

  

Resolution
When generating, I usually go for the maximum 4096x resolution for best quality. However, I’ve noticed that the results are most accurate when the aspect ratio matches the original image. For instance, if my original portrait is 960 by 1280, I set the output to 3072 by 4096 to preserve that same proportion. 
Prompt
a girl posing while seated on a chair. She has long, wavy platinum blonde hair with smooth, fair skin with a natural glow, lightly blushed cheeks, and slight freckles across her nose. She is wearing a shiny blue one-piece swimsuit with a deep neckline and high-cut sides.The background features purple-toned lighting, a paneled wall, and a quilted fabric surface, creating a modern and vibrant setting.
The key to prompting is to first describe the image of the second image (where you are swapping your influencer’s face onto).  For example with the input image above (the girl with the blue swimsuit with orange hair) had an original prompt 
“The image shows a young woman indoors, posing while seated on a chair. She has long, voluminous auburn-red hair with loose waves, and she is lightly holding a strand in her hand. Her facial features include fair skin, defined brows, bold eye makeup with winged eyeliner, long lashes, rosy blush, and glossy pink lips. She is wearing a shiny blue one-piece swimsuit with a deep neckline and high-cut sides. The background features purple-toned lighting, a paneled wall, and a quilted fabric surface, creating a modern and vibrant setting.” 
I replaced the prompt above with my influencer’s prompting for appearance. “She has long, wavy platinum blonde hair with smooth, fair skin with a natural glow, lightly blushed cheeks, and slight freckles across her nose”. Also changed the part “a girl posting while seated on a chair” to make sure one girl is being generated for the result. 


Result
  



In addition, you can use seedream 4.0 to generate different
* Face Angles (critical): Front, 3/4, profile, up/down shots

* Facial Expressions: Neutral, smiling, serious, plus 1–2 other emotions (avoid overdoing extremes).

* Body Poses & Composition:

   * Mix of close-ups, medium shots, and some full-body.

      * Clothing:

      * Clothing depends on the character’s concept: signature outfits should dominate, but adding some variation prevents overfitting. 

NanoBanana 
Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview – Image Model, also known as Nano Banana, is one of the most effective image-editing models our team has discovered for producing high-quality images.
NanoBanana is a great alternative to Seedream 4.0 when you want to explore more prompt variations without cost. Its web interface is often free or offers generous usage, giving you room to experiment with different prompts and styles.
When using NanoBanana, generate multiple versions of your face images. Then compare those outputs side-by-side with what Seedream 4.0 produces. Focus especially on facial details and consistency.
If a NanoBanana result shows sharper eyes, better lip rendering, or more consistent facial structure across multiple images, favor that version. If Seedream 4.0 gives you steadier consistency across many shots or better blending when merging portraits, then use those.
In practice:
         1. Run your prompt variants in both NanoBanana and Seedream 4.0.

         2. Collect the best candidates based on how well they keep the face consistent (same proportions, no weird distortions) and detailed (clear skin texture, eye detail, natural lighting).

         3. Use the version (from either model) for building your dataset for the LoRA influencer model.






Flux Kontext Face Swap
Flux Kontext Face Swap (Lora)
This workflow uses the Flux Kontext Dev model with a face-swap LoRA trained on the “Place It” LoRA (built on the Dev model).


Requirements
            * The original portrait image generated in Step 1 using the Instagirl WAN 2.2 workflow

            * A second image containing the head/face you want your influencer to swap to. This image can be generated from instagirl workflow or real images from instagram.
Controls
               * Use the scale factor on the node to adjust both the size and position of the swapped head.

Performance Notes
                  * The workflow is strong at color blending and preserving the prominent features of the face.

                  * It is not perfect at fully retaining the original image quality, but as long as the core facial features remain intact, the results are more than sufficient.

                  * These outputs work well when training the LoRA and attaching it to the WAN 2.2 model + Instagirl LoRA for influencer creation.

Step 3: Create Captions for your Images
Use the following prompts below on ChatGPT to generate a zip folder of captions. Make sure that your image file name matches the corresponding caption .txt file. Replace the [your trigger name] with your own. 


These are photos of [your trigger name], analyze those images and caption them correctly for a lora training using “ [your trigger name]” as the caption token and convert each single caption into a .txt file and name them all in the same order,  [your trigger name]_0001.txt,  [your trigger name]_0002.txt, etc and then finally zip them all into a zip file so I can download it. 


You can also try modifying your captions to describe more aspects of your character. The more detailed your description, the more those traits become “baked” into the model. For example, if you describe a feature in the photo, that keyword will become part of your character’s identity. In my case, if I just write “Elara” instead of “Elara with blonde hair,” the LoRA will interpret Elara as always having blonde hair. That means you won’t be able to easily change her hair color later, since it’s already been embedded into the model.


Step 4: Training Qwen Image Model (AiToolkit)
GPU / Runpod Template for AiToolkit
For the GPU our team likes training it on RTX PRO 6000 WorkStation or RTX PRO 6000 if the workstation is not available. 


If you want to train it locally, you will need at least a 5090 gpu (32gb vram). Use the low vram setting below to train your lora. It will just take longer than the RTX Pro 6000 series. 


Below is the Runpod template link to launch AItoolkit.


Use the Runpod Template (Run on RTX pro 6000 series / 5090) For 5090 use different settings below: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=vhz7dozb31&ref=i2biwt7p


I’m attaching the screenshots for the parameters on both RTX PRO 6000 workstation and 5090 gpu to train on AItoolkit


Datasets
First, click the datasets on the left side of Aitoolkit, and then create datasets. Then drag and drop all your image and caption pairs into the section. After that, click New Jobs and ensure that your dataset is correctly selected.  


Trigger word
In AI Toolkit, if you set a trigger_word in your config and leave your captions unchanged, the toolkit will automatically append that trigger word to the end of every caption during training. For example, if your caption is written as “A beautiful painting” and your trigger_word is wan22, the toolkit will read it as “A beautiful painting wan22.” This method is straightforward and works well when the trigger word doesn’t need to appear in a specific spot, such as for training a general style or aesthetic.
The second method uses the placeholder [trigger] directly in your caption text files. In this case, the toolkit will replace [trigger] with your chosen trigger_word wherever it appears in the sentence. For example, if your caption says “A [trigger] standing by the lake” and your trigger_word is wan22, the final caption becomes “A wan22 standing by the lake.” This approach gives you more precise control over the placement of the trigger word, which is especially useful when training objects, characters, or situations where word order matters.
However as we created the caption files and had trigger word on every txt file, it is not needed to worry about this. So leave the trigger word section empty

Step 5: Use the Character Lora In your workflow
Now that you’ve finished training your Qwen Image character model, it’s time to upload your LoRA model to the Runpod template and test the results.
First, launch the Runpod template below and wait until ComfyUI and Jupyter Lab finish loading. This is the Runpod template link for the Qwen Image Workflow:
Workflow Path: \Qwen\qwen instagram influencer workflow (Aiorbust).json
Use the Runpod Template (Must Run on 5090 GPU):
 https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=qhb8u6pngx&ref=i2biwt7p
Alternative: Use the Runpod Template (Must Run on 4090/3090GPU):
https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=9enej9uomy&ref=i2biwt7p




There are two ways to upload your LoRA model into the template. The first way is by manually dragging and dropping the file. Once Jupyter Lab loads, click the link and navigate to workspace → ComfyUI → models → loras. Drag and drop your LoRA model into that folder.
The second way is to upload your LoRA model to Hugging Face and use the wget command to pull it into the template. Start by creating a Hugging Face account, then click your profile icon and select New Model. Enter a repository name and create the repo. Once it’s created, go to your repo, click Contribute, then Upload File. Drag and drop your LoRA file into Hugging Face and commit it to the main branch.   
After the upload, click your model and copy the download link. Then, in your Runpod workspace, navigate to workspace → ComfyUI → models → loras and type wget <download_link> to pull your model.
  



After uploading your model, refresh ComfyUI — it will automatically recognize your new LoRA model.
Next, drag and drop the Qwen Instagram Influencer Workflow into ComfyUI and load your LoRA model in the LoRA section. You’ll generally get better results when using a reference image with the Qwen workflow. Start by going to Pinterest and finding an Instagram-style photo you want to emulate. Download that photo and ask ChatGPT to describe it in detail.
  



Then, replace all parts of the prompt that describe the original girl’s facial features with your AI influencer’s features. You can do this by uploading your AI influencer’s portrait photo to ChatGPT and asking for a description of her facial traits.
For example, if the Pinterest photo description says “a girl with sharp brown eyes, long wavy brunette hair, and a soft smile,” replace those parts with your AI influencer’s facial details to keep the same style while retaining your model’s identity.


Once ChatGPT gives you a description of your AI influencer’s facial features, you can use it to replace the facial details in your reference image prompt. For example, ChatGPT generated the following description for my influencer:
She is a beautiful woman with long, wavy platinum blonde hair, smooth fair skin with a natural glow, lightly blushed cheeks, and slight freckles across her nose.


Now take your original prompt for instance:
The image shows a young woman taking a mirror selfie in a bedroom. She is wearing a light blue lace top and a small pearl necklace. Her long dark hair frames her face, with soft bangs slightly parted in the middle. She is holding her phone up with one hand; the phone has a pink flame case. The bed in the background is neatly made with white bedding and decorative pillows, adding a cozy feel to the setting. The lighting highlights her natural features, giving the picture a calm and intimate vibe.


You would then replace the parts describing the girl’s appearance with your AI influencer’s traits. The new prompt becomes:


elaradreamcore taking a mirror selfie in a bedroom. She is wearing a light blue lace top and a small pearl necklace. She has long, wavy platinum blonde hair with smooth, fair skin with a natural glow, lightly blushed cheeks, and slight freckles across her nose. She is holding her phone up with one hand; the phone has a pink flame case. The bed in the background is neatly made with white bedding and decorative pillows, adding a cozy feel to the setting. The lighting highlights her natural features, giving the picture a calm and intimate vibe.


This method keeps the composition, setting, and lighting of your reference photo while adapting it to your AI influencer’s unique look ensuring that your generated results feel realistic, stylistically consistent, and true to your character.
